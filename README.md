This is a reddit bot that has one purpose: responding to anytime someone uses "Thunderdome" in reddit comments.

Inspired by the classic MST3K sketch : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEI_udV88i4

Because I'm lazy (but in this case, legitimately lazy) I've decided to store the posts I've responded to as a .txt file. Since I'm just having fun it shouldn't be too much of an issue.
